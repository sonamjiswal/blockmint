# BlockMint


## Project Title
BlockMint


## Project Description
BlockMint is a minimal Solidity project that demonstrates simple token minting, transferring, and ownership querying. It is intentionally lightweight so learners can study the core mechanics of token state management without the complexity of full ERC standards.


## Project Vision
Provide a clear, beginner-friendly foundation for building on-chain minting functionality. BlockMint is meant as a teaching example and starting point for extending into ERC-721, access control, metadata, and marketplace features.


## Key Features
- Mint tokens to any address (simple incremental token IDs)
- Transfer tokens between addresses with ownership checks
- Query token owner and enumerate tokens owned by an address
- Clean, well-commented Solidity code suitable for learning and extension


## Future Scope
- Upgrade to full ERC-721 compliance (metadata, approvals, safeTransferFrom)
- Add access control so only authorized minters can mint
- Integrate on-chain metadata and off-chain storage (IPFS)
- Add unit tests (Hardhat/Foundry) and deployment scripts
- Add front-end UI for minting and viewing tokens
